Simple ATM Machine (Console-based)



Requirements:

Start with a variable balance = 1000.

Show a menu:

1 → Check Balance

2 → Deposit

3 → Withdraw

4 → Exit

Use readline in Node.js (like you did in the guessing game).

Based on user input:

If they choose 1, print the balance.

If 2, ask how much to deposit, add to balance, and show new balance.

If 3, ask how much to withdraw:

If withdrawal ≤ balance → subtract and show new balance.

Else → show "Insufficient funds!".

If 4, exit with "Goodbye!"
